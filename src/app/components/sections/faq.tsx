        question: "What is Glimvia?",
        answer: "Glimvia is an independent, mobile-first client for Apache Superset. It allows you to access your dashboards, charts, and data insights from your phone, with an interface optimized for mobile devices."
    },
    {
        question: "Is Glimvia open source like Apache Superset?",
        answer: "Glimvia is a closed-source application. While it is built to connect to the open-source Apache Superset platform, Glimvia itself is a proprietary product developed and maintained by Woodfrog Design. This allows us to offer a dedicated mobile experience and support for our users."
    },
    {
        question: "How can I be sure my data is safe if the app isnâ€™t open source?",
        answer: (<span>We take data security very seriously. Your credentials are encrypted and stored only on your device, never on our servers. The app communicates directly with your Superset instance, and we do not collect or store any of your dashboard data. You can find more details in our <a href='/privacy' className='text-primary underline'>Privacy Policy</a>.</span>)
    },
    {
        question: "What specific data does Glimvia access, and where is it stored?",
        answer: (
            <div className="space-y-2">
                <p>Glimvia is designed to access only the information necessary to provide you with a seamless mobile experience. Here's a breakdown:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>What we access:</strong> The app accesses your Superset instance URL and your username to authenticate you. It then fetches the dashboard and chart data that you have permission to view.</li>
                    <li><strong>Where it's stored:</strong> All of this information is stored locally and securely on your device. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your information, and the dashboard data is cached on your device for faster loading times and offline access.</li>
                    <li><strong>What we don't do:</strong> We do not store your password, or any of your dashboard data on our servers. We do not track your usage of specific dashboards or charts. The only data we collect is anonymous crash reports and usage analytics, which help us improve the app.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We believe this approach provides the best balance of performance, convenience, and security.</p>
            </div>

    },
    {
        question: "I cannot log in. What should I do?",
        answer: "Please ensure your Superset instance URL is correct, including 'http://' or 'https://'. Double-check your username and password. If your instance uses SSO (like Google or Okta), that is not yet supported."
    },
    {
        question: "My dashboard is not loading or shows a blank screen.",
        answer: "This can happen due to network issues or if a chart on the dashboard is too complex for mobile rendering. Try pulling down to refresh. If the problem persists, check your connection and the dashboard's complexity on desktop."
    },
    {
        question: "Why am I getting an 'Invalid Credentials' error?",
        answer: (<span>This means the username or password you entered is incorrect. Please verify your credentials for the Superset instance you are trying to connect to. Remember that passwords are case-sensitive. The error message is: <code className='bg-muted text-muted-foreground rounded-sm px-1 py-0.5 text-sm'>Invalid Credentials</code></span>)
    },
    {
        question: "How do I switch between dashboards?",
        answer: "You can navigate between your dashboards using the main list on the home screen. You can also favorite dashboards to have them appear at the top for quick access."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use Glimvia on desktop?",
        answer: "Glimvia is designed as a mobile-first application. While you can run it on a desktop simulator, the primary and intended use case is on iOS and Android devices. For desktop, we recommend using the standard Apache Superset web interface."
    },
    {
        question: "The app logs me out automatically. Why?",
        answer: "For security, Glimvia respects the session timeout configured on your Superset instance. If your session expires, you will be logged out automatically. You may need to ask your Superset administrator to adjust session length if needed."
    },
    {
        question: "What should I do if the app crashes?",
        answer: "If the app crashes, please try restarting it. If the issue continues, please report it through the 'Support' page, providing as much detail as possible about what you were doing when it crashed."
    },
    {
        question: "Why are some charts shown as tables?",
        answer: "Glimvia supports a wide range of Superset's core visualizations. However, some highly custom or complex chart types may not be fully supported for mobile rendering. In these cases, Glimvia displays the underlying data in a table format to ensure you can still access the information."
